# Dummy User App (Angular application)

## Development server

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code
1. Ensure you have node installed.
2. Download or clone the code from this repository. (Make sure to use the master repo)
3. Navigate to the NGSpring-NgApp folder
    There should be a package.json file in this folder.
4. In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type npm install
    Make sure that you are in the root folder (same folder where package.json file is located).
    
    This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. 
    You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
